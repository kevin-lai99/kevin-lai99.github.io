    <h1>Identity Values</h1>
    <h2>
      <u>
        What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego
        due to the Human Skills learning?
      </u>
    </h2>
    <li>My ego resists feedback more than I thought</li>
    <li>I associate my identity too closely with my performance</li>
    <li>Vulnerability does not equal weakness</li>

    <h2>
      <u>
        What are the role of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning and
        programming?
      </u>
    </h2>
    <p>
      Values play a foundational role in both learning and programming. They
      influence your motivation and approach, whether you prioritize curiosity,
      collaboration, or integrity. In programming, your values shape how you
      write code, work with others, and make decisions that affect long-term
      maintainability and user trust.
    </p>
    <p>
      Empathy is essential for understanding others, whether you're learning
      alongside peers or building software for real users. It helps you consider
      different perspectives, communicate better in teams, and create solutions
      that are accessible, user-friendly, and genuinely helpful to the people
      who will use them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Self-awareness allows you to recognize your strengths and areas for
      growth. In learning, it helps you adjust your strategies and manage
      challenges like procrastination or perfectionism. In programming, it
      supports reflection, openness to feedback, and the emotional intelligence
      needed to grow and collaborate effectively.

    <h2>
      <u>What has surprised you the most about the Human Skills learning?</u>
    </h2>
    <p>
      What surprised me most about the Human Skills learning was how deeply it
      impacted not just how I interact with others, but how I understand myself.
      I initially expected it to focus mainly on communication techniques or
      teamwork strategies, but it went much deeper, encouraging real
      self-reflection, emotional awareness, and personal growth. I didn't
      anticipate how much my mindset and behaviors would shift just by becoming
      more conscious of things like active listening, vulnerability, and how my
      ego shows up in daily interactions. It's been more transformative than I
      expected
    </p>
    <h2>
      <u
        >What were the most challenging aspects of the Human Skills learning?</u
      >
    </h2>
    <p>
      One of the most challenging aspects of the Human Skills learning was
      becoming aware of my own blind spots, especially around how I communicate
      and react under stress. It was uncomfortable at times to confront the ways
      my ego can get defensive or how I might unintentionally shut down open
      dialogue. Another challenge was practicing vulnerability in real
      conversations, particularly in group settings. Letting go of the need to
      always appear confident. It ultimately led to deeper, more authentic
      connections with others.

    <h2>
      <u>
        Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time
        focusing on Human Skills learning in a web development Bootcamp
        course?</u
      >
    </h2>
    <p>
      I think a programming school focuses on Human Skills because technical
      skills alone aren't enough to thrive in the real world of web development.
      In the industry, success often depends just as much on communication,
      teamwork, and self-awareness as it does on coding ability. Developers work
      in teams, navigate feedback, handle pressure, and build products for real
      people. So being able to collaborate, listen, and empathize is essential.
      Human Skills help us become not just better coders, but better
      problem-solvers, teammates, and professionals.
    </p>
    <h2>
      <u
        >Does the time you spent studying Human Skills learning here feel like a
        waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practise
        programming instead? Justify your answer.</u
      >
    </h2>
    <p>
      No, the time spent on Human Skills learning definitely doesn't feel like a
      waste. In fact, I think it's been essential. While programming practice is
      obviously important, the ability to collaborate, give and receive
      feedback, manage stress, and communicate effectively is what separates a
      good developer from a great one. In the real world, code is written in
      teams, under deadlines, with clients or users in mind. Without strong
      Human Skills, even the most technically skilled developers can struggle in
      those environments. The learning here has made me more self aware, more
      adaptable, and ultimately more prepared for the realities of working in
      tech.
