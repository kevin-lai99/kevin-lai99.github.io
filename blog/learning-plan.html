    <h1>Learning Plan</h1>
    <h2><u>Bootcamp Learning Plan</u></h2>
    <h2>1.What is your long term goal and/or career pathway?</h2>
    <p>To be invloved in a web dev related career</p>
    <h2>
      hat do you think your biggest strengths and limitations will be in
      Bootcamp?
    </h2>
    <p>My key strengths and limitations remained the same.</p>

    <h2>
      What do you think your biggest non-technical challenge at Bootcamp will
      be?
    </h2>
    <p>
      My biggest challenge will most likely be waking up in the morning and
      asking for assistance when needed.
    </p>
    <h2>
      What non-technical skills - human skills - would you like to see developed
      in yourself while at Dev Academy?
    </h2>
    <p>
      The same as before, be able to get distracted less and be more open to ask
      for assistance. Also being better at receiving/giving feedback.
    </p>
    <h2>What are your expectations from the Bootcamp team?</h2>
    <p>To be there to help when needed during work hours.</p>
    <h2>What are your expectations of yourself on Bootcamp</h2>
    <p>
      My expectation of myself during Bootcamp is to stay fully engaged. I know
      the pace will be intense, so I aim to manage my time well, ask for help
      when I need it, and push through challenges rather than avoid them.
    </p>
    <h2 id="FLP"><u>Foundational Learning Plan</u></h2>
    <h2>1.What is your long term goal or career pathway?</h2>

      To be able to build websites and be invloved in a web development career
    </p>
    <h2>
      2.A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to
      learning
    </h2>
    <p>
      My key strengths are perseverance, adaptability, and curiosity while my
      main limitations are the ability to stay focus, procrasination and
      struggling to ask for assistance.
    </p>
    <h2>
      3.What skills (non-technical/human skills) would you like to see developed
      in yourself while at Dev Academy?
    </h2>
    <p>
      Be able to get distracted less and be more open to ask for assistance.
    </p>
    <h2>
      4.A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme.
    </h2>
    <p>
      I like to have a skim thruough the sprint before I start, have a look the
      the timeboxes and divide the workload evenly across the week. When things
      are building up, I would try to get as much work done as possible at the
      start instead of dividing the workload, this way there will be extra time
      later in the week for work that went over the timebox limit.
    </p>
    <h2>
      5.A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way
    </h2>
    <p>
      I will try to seek help whenever I encounter challenges beyond my ability
      to manage alone, by reaching out to facilitators, others in my cohort, and
      friends.
    </p>
    <h2>6.A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team</h2>
    <p>
      To be there to help when needed during work hours (maybe after hours when
      things are starting to build up).
