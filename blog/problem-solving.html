    <h1>Problem Solving</h1>
    <h2><u>A time I was blocked on a simple problem</u></h2>
    <p>
      I was working on this small project in Uni, a to-do list app. Everything
      was going great until I tried to make the “delete” button. Every time I
      clicked 'delete', it deleted every item instead of just one. At first, I
      stared at my code hoping the bug would just reveal itself to me. That
      obviously didn't work. So I started adding couple of console.log
      statements which helped me realize that I was referencing the wrong index
      when deleting items. I also did some intense googling as always, trying to
      find the bug. It felt pretty frustrating through out the whole thing,
      especially since I assumed it should've been an “easy fix.” It reminded me
      that even simple problems can have not-so-simple causes
    </p>
    <h2><u>A time I elegantly solved a problem.</u></h2>
    <p>
      I needed to sort a list of tasks by priority, from urgent to least
      important. I started with pseudocode, just writing out what needed to
      happen in plain English. I then used a built-in array sort function with a
      custom comparison function. It was short and readable. I was honestly
      surprised by how smooth the code writing was. That moment taught me how
      effective it can be to take a second to plan before diving into code. The
      solution ended up being simple because I didn't overcomplicate it from the
      start.

    </h2>
    <p>
      As far as problem-solving techniques go, I'm pretty confident with most of
      the core ones now. Pseudocode is great, I usually feel clear-headed when I
      use it, but I forget to do it consistently. Trying something” as an
      exploratory approach is super useful too, though I've learned it works
      better when I still have some direction. The rubber ducky method is
      surprisingly effective. I'll sometimes catch my own mistake just from
      hearing myself explain it. Reading error messages has grown on me, they're
      annoying at first, but usually give good clues. console.log is my absolute
      go-to, I use it constantly to peek into what my code is doing. Googling is
      basically a natural instinct now, whenever I'm stuck on something, I have
      google ready on the second monitor instantly. Asking for help from peers
      and coaches is something i still need to work on. More often than not I
      find myself stuck on a cycle of finding bugs and googling for hours before
      even thinking of asking for help. Reflecting on my progress has been quite
      useful. Whenever I take a little time to think back on what worked or what
      didn't, I notice I handle the next problem better.

    <h2>
      <u>
        Reflect on a time you were reluctant to ask for help. Consider what made
        you reluctant to do so. What might you try differently next time?
      </u>
    </h2>
    <p>
      There was definitely a time I hesitated to ask for help. During a group
      project, I ran into a bug that I just couldn't solve. But I didn't want to
      ask my teammates because I was worried they'd think I wasn't doing my
      part. So I struggled with it for hours, quietly frustrated, and honestly
      made things harder than they needed to be. Looking back, I realize it
      wasn't about my teammates, it was about my own pride and insecurity. Next
      time, I'd ask earlier. I'd remind myself that everyone needs help
      sometimes, and no one is going to think less of me for it. In fact, it
      shows you're taking the work seriously when you're willing to ask good,
      thoughtful questions.
