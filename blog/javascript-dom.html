    <h1>JS Fundamentals</h1>
    <h2><u>What is Javascript?</u></h2>
    <p>
      Javascript is a computer programming language commonly used to create
      interactive effects within web browsers. It is used to make things "work"
      on a web page.
    </p>
    <p>Lets say you're building a house, you have:</p>
    <li>
      HTML: The structure, the walls, the roof, the windows. It tells the
      browser what should be on the page.
    </li>
    <li>
      CSS: The paint, wallpaper, and furniture. It makes the web page look good.
    </li>
    <li>
      JavaScript: The electricity and plumbing.It connect things on the web page
      and make things work. Like clicking a light switch and the light actually
      turning on.
    </li>

    <h2><u>Control Flow and Loop</u></h2>
    <p>
      Control Flow is like following a step by step recipe when baking cookies,
      you can also add conditions to change which steps of the recipe to follow.
      The 'if' and 'else' statements in the code are the conditions added to
      determine whether more milk or flour should be added
    </p>
    <div id="p2-1st">
      <div>
        <ol id="recipe">
          <li>Preheat oven</li>
          <li>Mix ingredients</li>
          <li>
            If dough too dry, add more milk, if dough too wet, add more flour
          </li>
          <li>Scoop dough</li>
          <li>Bake for 15 minutes</li>
        </ol>
      </div>
      <div>
        <img id="bake" src="../images/bake.jpg" />
      </div>
    </div>
    <p>
      Lets say you want to bake 10 cookies, meaning you need 10 scoops of dough.
      Writing out the function ScoopDough() 10 times is impractical. This is
      where loops come in. This way the ScoopDough can be executed multiple
      times with just a couple lines of code.
    </p>
    <img id="loop" src="../images/loop.jpg" />

    <h2><u>The DOM</u></h2>
    <p>
      The DOM (Document Object Model) is JavaScript's way of seeing and
      interacting with your web page. Imagine your website is a big tree. The
      DOM is like the map of that tree — where each part is a branch you can
      grab and play with. JavaScript can “talk” to the DOM and make changes.
      This grabs the element with the id "Hello", and changes its text to "Hi!"
    </p>
    <img id="domss" src="../images/domss.jpg" />
    <p>
      <button id="Hello" type="button" onclick="change()">
        This will change to 'Hi' when clicked
      </button>
    </p>
    <h2><u>Arrays vs Objects</u></h2>
    <p>
      Arrays and objects are similar, but differnt in their own way. Lets say
      you have a backpack.
    </p>
    <p>
      Arrays are things you put in the backpack in a specific order. Like a
      list, you pull things out by their position.
    </p>
    <img id="array" src="../images/array.jpg" />
    <p>
      Obects are like the labeled compartments, they are useful when you want to
      know 'what' something is not just 'where' something is.
    </p>
    <img id="object" src="../images/object.jpg" />

    <h2><u>Functions</u></h2>
    <p>
      Functions are like recipes. They tell the computer how to do something,
      step-by-step, and you can re-use them anytime you want without rewriting
      the whole thing.
    </p>
    <p>Lets say you want to introduce yourself:</p>
    <img id="function" src="../images/function.jpg" />
    <p>
      Functions save you time, help you stay organized, and keep your code clean
      and easy to understand.
