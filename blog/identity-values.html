    <h1>Identity Values</h1>
    <h2>
      1.Explain a situation where you have made an ethical decision. Discuss how
      you weighed up the values involved in that decision, the decision you
      made, and how you reflect on the decision now.
    </h2>
    <p>
      It was during one of my part time jobs in a resturant where I forgot to
      charge a customer for their drinks. I contemplated on whether I should
      tell someone about this or just let it slide. In the end i told my manager
      about it and owned up to my mistakes. Thinking back, I think I made the
      right decision. Although the value of the drink is small, it is about
      being honest and responsible for my mistakes.
    </p>
    <h2>
      2.Describe how your culture and the people around you have influenced your
      values and identity.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Growing up in a Chinese cultural environment, my values and identity have
      been deeply shaped by the traditions, philosophies, and societal
      expectations of my heritage. Principles such as respect for elders, filial
      piety, and the importance of education, have played a significant role in
      shaping my sense of duty and responsibility. I was taught to prioritize
      family and collective well-being over individual desires, reinforcing the
      idea that success is not just personal but also a reflection of my
      family's efforts. Our culture places great emphasis on perseverance and
      hard work, to endure hardships and remain resilient. This mindset has
      influenced my approach to challenges, teaching me to persist even in
      difficult times.
    </p>
    <h2>
      3.Identify your strengths and how they will support you during your
      learning journey.
    </h2>
    <p>
      My key strengths include perseverance, adaptability, and curiosity. These
      qualities will support me throughout my learning journey. Growing up in a
      culture that values resilience, I have learned to push through challenges
      and setbacks. This determination will help me stay committed to my
      studies, even when I face difficulties or failures. My adaptability allows
      me to embrace different learning styles, technologies, and perspectives,
      ensuring that I can thrive in any educational setting. My curiosity drives
      me to ask questions, seek deeper understanding, and engage actively in my
      education. This will help me stay motivated and open to discovering new
      knowledge.
    </p>
    <h2>
      4.Evaluate your limitations in terms of your learning and career
      development. How might these affect your learning journey?
    </h2>

    <p>
      Limitations that may impact my learning and career are the ability to stay
      focus, procrasination and asking for help. I tend to get distracted easily
      and procrasinates before and while working, this slows down my progess as
      time is wasted before proper work gets done. I tend to also rely on myself
      rather than seeking help, this might affect me when tackling complex
      topics.
    </p>
    <h2>
      5.Share an example of when you were trying to work productively with
      others, but there was resistance or tension. Discuss strategies you tried
      at the time, how effective they were, and your reflections on what other
      strategies you would try now and why.
    </h2>
    <p>
      During a group project in school, I was assigned to work with a team where
      one member was not contributing equally. While the rest of us were trying
      to complete the project on time, this team member often missed meetings
      and did not complete their assigned tasks. This created frustration and
      tension within the group. The strategies we've tried are open
      communication, task reassignment, and setting clear deadlines. These
      approaches somewhat worked, however some of the team members were
      unsatisfied as they would have to take on extra work to get all the work
      completed. Something I would do differently now is to set early
      expectations, meaning setting small deadlines on different parts of the
      project. This can make sure all members are on the same pace, meaning no
      members are significantly behind. I would also try encouraging
      collaborative work. Working in pairs or goups of three keeps the members
      more engages and motivated.
