    <h1>Emotional Intelligence</h1>
    <h2><u>What is Emotional Intelligence?</u></h2>
    <p>
      Emotional intelligence is the ability to understand, manage, and use your
      own emotions in positive ways to communicate effectively, empathize with
      others, overcome challenges, and defuse conflict. It also involves
      recognizing and influencing the emotions of others.
    </p>
    <h2><u>Difference between IQ and EQ</u></h2>
    <p>
      IQ is a measure of how well someone can think, solve problems, and
      understand complex ideas. It looks at things like logic, math skills,
      memory, and language ability. IQ is often linked to school performance and
      how well someone can handle technical tasks.
    </p>
    <p>
      EQ is about understanding emotionsâ€”both your own and other people's. It
      includes being aware of your feelings, controlling them, and using that
      understanding to handle relationships and social situations. EQ helps with
      communication, empathy, managing stress, and working well with others.
    </p>
    <p>
      The main difference is that IQ measures thinking ability, while EQ
      measures emotional and social skills. IQ can help you do well in school or
      technical jobs, but EQ is important for building relationships, being a
      good team player, and becoming a strong leader.
    </p>
    <h2><u>Why is EQ important?</u></h2>
    <p>
      EQ is important because it helps you understand and manage emotions, both
      your own and other people's. This improves communication, reduces
      conflict, and strengthens relationships. It's useful in all areas of life.
      Personally, it helps me manage stress and make better decisions. Overall,
      EQ helps you stay in control, connect with people, and grow as a person.
